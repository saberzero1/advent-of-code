    "He doesn't know anything about the missing machine parts; he's only visiting for this research project. However, he confirms that the hot springs are the next-closest area likely to have people; he'll even take you straight there once he's done with today's observation analysis.\n",

    "\n",
    "Due to something involving gravitational effects, **only some space expands**. In fact, the result is that **any rows or columns that contain no galaxies** should all actually be twice as big.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, three columns and two rows contain no galaxies:\n",

    "8....9.......\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This path has length **`9`** because it takes a minimum of **nine steps** to get from galaxy `5` to galaxy `9` (the eight locations marked `#` plus the step onto galaxy `9` itself). Here are some other example shortest path lengths:\n",
