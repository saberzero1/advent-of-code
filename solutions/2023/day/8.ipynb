    "\n",
    "One of the camel's pouches is labeled \"maps\" - sure enough, it's full of documents (your puzzle input) about how to navigate the desert. At least, you're pretty sure that's what they are; one of the documents contains a list of left/right instructions, and the rest of the documents seem to describe some kind of **network** of labeled nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "It seems like you're meant to use the **left/right** instructions to **navigate the network**. Perhaps if you have the camel follow the same instructions, you can escape the haunted wasteland!\n",
    "\n",
    "After examining the maps for a bit, two nodes stick out: `AAA` and `ZZZ`. You feel like `AAA` is where you are now, and you have to follow the left/right instructions until you reach `ZZZ`.\n",

    "GGG = (GGG, GGG)\n",
    "ZZZ = (ZZZ, ZZZ)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting with `AAA`, you need to look up the next element based on the next left/right instruction in your input. In this example, start with `AAA` and go right (`R`) by choosing the right element of `AAA`, **`CCC`**. Then, `L` means to choose the **left** element of `CCC`, **`ZZZ`**. By following the left/right instructions, you reach `ZZZ` in **`2`** steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, you might not find `ZZZ` right away. If you run out of left/right instructions, repeat the whole sequence of instructions as necessary: `RL` really means `RLRLRLRLRLRLRLRL...` and so on. For example, here is a situation that takes **`6`** steps to reach `ZZZ`:\n",

Repeat this process until **all** of the nodes you're currently on end with `Z`. (If only some of the nodes you're on end with `Z`, they act like any other node and you continue as normal.) In this example, you would proceed as follows:\n",
